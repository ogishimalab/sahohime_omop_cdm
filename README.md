# Sahohime OMOP CDM data

The project is based on converting the Sahohime dataset into the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) format. Sahohime is a publicly available pseudonymized health dataset provided by OHDSI Japan (https://www.ohdsi-japan.org/pseudodata). It was designed as a synthetic dataset that mimics the structure and characteristics of real clinical data, allowing researchers to develop, test, and demonstrate data models and analytic pipelines without handling sensitive personal information. By using Sahohime as the source, this project ensures reproducibility, transparency, and data privacy while showcasing how Japanese healthcare data can be harmonized into OMOP CDM for international interoperability and collaborative research.
